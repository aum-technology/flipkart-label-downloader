This Chrome Extension downloads Flipkart Labels sorted by SKU & multi item shipment at the end of output pdf. Proudly developed by https://aum.technology

Flipkart Label Downloader Extension is intended for flipkart sellers.

This module can download flipkart shipping labels and can crop according to the specific size, by the way it has default size set which is pretty well for label printing.

Moreover, it'll sort shipments by SKU & put the labels of combo shipments(eg. More than 1 quantity order item shipments) at the end of the output pdf file.
So, it gets a lot easier for the seller to pack the labels from warehouse or a shop!
